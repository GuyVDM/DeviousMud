Welcome to my personal project in which I try to make my own reinterpretation of DeviousMUD2D using ENet.

[KNOWN BUGS]
- Some clients do not log out properly serverside, client data gets wiped but player data still remains, meaning ghost players exist.
- Client randomly crashes after a while.
- Walking animation resets every walk cycle.
- Player sometimes doesn't spawn.
- Right click options sometimes visually shows 2 selected.
- If you create a text component with empty text, it breaks.
