Welcome to my personal project in which I try to make my own reinterpretation of DeviousMUD2D using ENet.

[KNOWN BUGS]
- None known as of now.

[BACKLOG]
- Move m_Parent from protected to Private access modifier, and implement a const getter function for the parent pointer.
- Optimize path simulation clientsided as it's now currently a bit janky.
